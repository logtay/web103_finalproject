## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to make a lot of progress on both the front and the backend. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

It was hard to decide who was doing what. We were unsure of how to divide everything up and how to communicate it all on the Project Board in a way that made sense to the whole group. We also had to make minor changes to our table designs to better fit what we wanted our app to do.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We didn't have a set list of tasks for the week and this is why we had some trouble dividing up the work. We will prioritize the remaining tasks by being more specific on what needs to be done and who will be doing what. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We are still planning to have some type of media upload but we are unsure of how exactly we will implement it. If it remains at risk we will switch to a simpler URL upload. There are some "nice to have" stretch features that we have spoken about adding but are leaving off until we are sure that we have time. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

So far we are on track, but we may need advice on the most efficient way to handle certain features/how to implement some of the suggestions we got on pitch day if we have time.
