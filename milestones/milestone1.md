## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well during this unit was that that our group was able to brainstorm easily. We were able to share our ideas without any tension between group members. It was easy to voice suggestions and improvements. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge that our group faced in this unit was settling on an intial idea. We each had ideas that were either broad or that we weren't sure how practical they would be to implement. We had to collaborate and build off of one another's ideas to come to a final decision. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

One of the features of our app involves uploading files. We have some ideas on how to implement it but may need some support on what the best approach would be.
