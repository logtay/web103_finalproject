## About
A website where you can store and relive beloved memories of your loved ones. 

### Description and Purpose

Meant to store videos/pictures of loved ones throughout the years. It's easy to lose track of information throughout the years or lose storage trying to retain them all.

### Inspiration

It was inspired by the personal experience of looking back in older memories through phones and wishing we had more storage to keep them and as it's easy to lose track of them due to time and finding the exact related memory due to lack of tags phones typically have when navigating.

## Tech Stack


Frontend: React

Backend: PostgreSQL, and Node.js

## Features

### ✅ Add a new memory

The user can create a new memory that they would like to save. They can add various details such as: title, the loved one's name the memory is related to, description, and an image or audio file.
